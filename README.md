I'm Ram. I'm a long-time software developer and open-source activist from Tel Aviv, Israel. Almost all of my work is in Python. On my GitHub page you'll find a bunch of open-source projects I've authored or contributed to over the years.

Right now I'm working on research in machine learning, specifically in the field of [multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning). This research is the most interesting thing I've ever done. The goal is to improve AI safety by making an AI that's capable of understanding social behavior and ethical issues. 

Please check out my research site for lots of information about it: http://r.rachum.com
