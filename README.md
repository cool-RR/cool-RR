I'm Ram, an AI Safety researcher with a background in software engineering.

I'm applying [multi-agent reinforcement learning]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_reinforcement_learning)) to AI Safety. I want to ensure that Artificial Intelligence will benefit human society rather than hurt it. I'm addressing both short-term consequences of existing AI tools such as LLMs and long-term existential risk imposed by the potential development of Artificial General Intelligence.

I propose to solve the problem of AI Safety by improving the social behavior of AI agents. Most AI research is focused on getting AI agents to solve bigger and more complex problems in the most efficient way possible; my research is focused on achieving cooperation, reciprocity and teamwork between AI agents.

My strategy is to distill lessons from the study of animal and human societies and apply them to AI agents.
